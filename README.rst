Ultralight axion cores in gravitational lensing time delays
==============================

This repository hosts the programs needed to obtain the results showed in the paper ...
We used the [lenstronomy](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy) module to perform our analysis.

Abstract
--------
We consider the possibility that the cored ground state ("soliton") of ultralight dark matter (ULDM)
is responsible for the mismatch between the value of :math:`H_0` deduced from the cosmic microwave
background to that deduced from quasar time delays in galaxy lensing.

Notebooks
---------
For fast visualization and understanding of how we obtained our results,
we prepared dedicated jupyter notebooks:

* ``galaxy_plots.ipynb``:
* ``Velocity_dispersion.ipynb``:
* ``Mock_analysis_uldm2PL.ipynb``:
* ``Mock_analysis_uldm2uldm_No_H0_prior.ipynb``:
* ``Mock_analysis_uldm2uldm_H0_prior.ipynb``:
