ULDM and the Strong Lensing H0
==============================

This repository hosts the programs needed to obtain the results showed in the ...
We used the [lenstronomy](https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy) module to perform our analysis.

Our goal is to understand if the Hubble tension in measurements of strong gravitational lensing can be explained by the presence of large ULDM cores in elliptical galaxies. The idea is to set a sharp prior on the Hubble constant based on CMB data and see what are the ULDM parameter values that are compatible with this idea, according to lensing data.
